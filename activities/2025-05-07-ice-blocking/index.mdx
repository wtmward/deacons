❄️ Chill Thrills Alert! ❄️

YOU’RE INVITED TO THE COOLEST EVENT OF THE SUMMER… ICE BLOCKING!

When: Wed 5/07 at 7:00 PM (sharp… or risk melting 🫠)
Where: Cortessa Park – Meet at the basketball court!
Pickup: 8:00 PM (Parents/rides: We’ll thaw out by then, promise).

What to bring:
💧 Water (stay hydrated, not frostbitten).
🩳 A towel (for sitting on… or dramatic post-slide poses).

What I’ll bring:
🧊 6 GIANT ICE BLOCKS (first come, first slide!).

The Plan:

1. Grab a block.
2. Find the steepest hill.
3. SIT, SLIDE, REPEAT (until the ice—or your courage—runs out).

Warning: You will get wet. You might laugh until you cry. You’ll definitely bond over shared regret (and laughter).

RSVP: Just show up… but bring your need for speed!

P.S. Friends welcome! The more, the slippier! 😉

See you on the slopes (aka Cortessa’s legendary hills)!
