Upcoming Combined Activity – Thursday, April 17

Details:

- Time: 5:00 PM
- Location: Church Building
- Note: This activity is scheduled for Thursday (instead of the usual day) due to no school on Good Friday.

Event Information:

- We’ll be joining the YW1 class for a combined activity.
- The pageant begins at 8:00 PM, but since it’s pretty close to Easter, we’d like to arrive early to secure good seating and avoid the crowds.

What to Bring/Prepare:

- Snacks & Water: Please have your kids eat beforehand and/or bring light snacks and water.
- Jackets: The forecast predicts windy weather, so a jacket is recommended.
- Attire: No strict dress code, but we encourage respectful and comfortable clothing.

We’re looking forward to a wonderful evening together! Let us know if you have any questions.
