Bishop was finally able to coordinate with Sister Madeline Smith, and I went over to visit her to discuss scheduling.

Important Change:
We’ll be meeting at 5:30 PM tonight instead of the usual 7:00 PM due to how early it gets dark. Having more daylight will likely help us be more productive.

Here are the details:

Subject: Fruit Picking at Sister Madeline Smith’s

- Location: Sister Madeline Smith’s home (near Ken off 183rd).
- Access: The south gate will be left unlocked for us to drive in. The fruit trees are accessible from there.
- Fruit Details:
  - 6 fruit trees (type unknown) need to be picked.
  - Sister Smith will keep some fruit for juicing but has indicated there will be plenty to share.
  - Everyone who participates can likely take home a bag of citrus.

Logistics:

- Meeting Point: Ken’s house at 5:30 PM.
- Agenda:
  - Start with prayer and a brief message about service/priesthood responsibilities.

Supplies Needed:

- We will provide:
  - 10 buckets
  - A couple of boxes for fruit
  - 2 ladders
- Participants should bring:
  - Headlamps or flashlights
  - Gloves
  - Pole pickers (if available) to reach high fruit.

Looking forward to working together on this service opportunity!
