Hi @everyone,

I apologize for not sharing more details yet. Unfortunately, I don’t have much information about the race at this time. I’ve tried emailing ACP, posting questions on their Facebook page, and spending time searching online, but there doesn’t seem to be much available.

For now, I assume the boys can pack a lunch or bring some spending money for the food trucks. You’ll probably also want to send them with some water.

We’ll plan to meet at my house at 10:00 AM tomorrow morning, and I expect we’ll be back home around 2:00 PM.

I’ll make sure to provide more frequent updates tomorrow.

Thank you for your patience!
